## About this project

For a specific use case, I needed to integrate a Git diff visualizer. While there are many great components available online, I wanted to build one from scratch to better understand how diffs work and to minimize external dependencies for such a simple feature.

This project is still a work in progress, with several improvements planned (see the roadmap). However, I'm quite happy with this first version and its current capabilities.
